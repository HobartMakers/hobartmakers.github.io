          <h1>Frequently Asked Questions</h1>

          <h3>:mag: Who are Hobart Makers?</h3>
          <p>We're a growing band of <del>social misfits</del> makers in Hobart, Tasmania. We welcome people of any age, gender, skill level and from any background.</p>
          <p>We have a management committee of five: Craig Marshall, Scott Bragg, Michael Emery, Paul Attrill and Mary Marshall - plus at least half a dozen other makers ready and waiting to sign up.</p>

          <p>Our organisation is brand new and really, we're still getting started, but we are actively looking for new members to join us and help out!</p>
          
          <h3>:thought_balloon: Why do you exist?</h3>
          <p>Our big goal is to bring together and build a large and supportive maker community. We'll host lots of regular meetups, demonstrations, workshops and making sessions to help us reach this goal. We've recently announced our first workshop, which is <b>"Crochet for beginners"</b>. This is due to run on the 7th March 2017. Price, times, location, etc. can be seen on the <a href="https://hobartmakers.tidyhq.com/public/events">events</a> page.</p>

          <p>Our daily activities include promoting and encouraging people to <b>make things</b> (or to repair, modify, tinker, repurpose, etc.). Most of us have backgrounds in software and electronics, but we're very keen to promote <b>any</b> crafts and skills that are interesting to our members.</p>

          <p>Come and meet us and you'll get the idea! :slight_smile:</p>

          <h3>:label: Why Hobart Makers, and not Hobart Makerspace?</h3>
          <p>Our thinking is that the makers themselves and the community are much more interesting and important than the physical space and the tools. The people are the end, and the space and tools are the means.</p>

          <p>There are plenty of buildings around Hobart that are low-cost or free to use, but it is very handy to have workshop or office space to use whenever we want, and to store equipment in, so we've been on the lookout for a suitable space.</p>

          <p>Recently, we have been lucky enough to have found a very nice little space in New Town, 5-10 mins north of Hobart City. Come to one of our events and you can check it out.</p>

          <h3>:dollar: What does membership cost?</h3>
          <p>One of our distinguishing features is that our membership fees are going to be very flexible. We're putting our trust in the generous and sharing spirit of the Hobart maker community by implementing a "pay what you can afford" system. Of course we have operating expenses, so there will be a suggested membership price, but we do not want to turn away any makers that cannot afford it. We'd rather close our makerspace doors, and remain a mobile maker group, teaching, learning and making in other spaces, than turn people away.</p>
